OCTA is a tool for test case documents classification, which aims to improve its quality using Machine Learning and NLP in the context of oracle problem.

### Getting Started

Just download or fork this project. This is only the part of the project that classifies text using TF-IDF and Support Vector Machine. For contract purposes I cannot make public the entire application.

### Prerequisites

Install the requirements and run oracle_solver.py

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
and

```
python oracle_solver.py
```

## Built With
